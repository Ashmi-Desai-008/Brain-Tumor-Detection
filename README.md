# Brain-Tumor-Detection
Medical images plays a pivotal role in the early detection and diagnosis of various heath conditions, including brain tumors. Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI) is a powerful diagnostic tool that provides detailed images of the brain, allowing healthcare professionals to visualize abnormalities and anomalies with high precisions.
The aim of this project is to detect the tumor using deep learning methods in early stage.
